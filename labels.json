Projects\n Atlas\n Description\n This project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions.  There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler.  A tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor submits availability.  A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring.  Also, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project.  The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task which runs every day.  Responsibilities\n Created a Availability Calendar Grid.  In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week.  Clicking on the cell toggles the availability.  Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data) Developed C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.  Got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled.  Created Class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.  Integrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website.  Used jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations.  Used role based authorization for various pages.  The goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies.  Adding functionalities to upload pdf files.  Responsilities\n Created separate Login page for Administrator and Students.  Used Active Directory (AD Group) to restrict other department Students.  Developed a web interface for Administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students.  Updated the entire application by using new Visual Studio 2013 template which make use of Bootstrap CSS by changing the master pages.  Modified the structure of database to login.  Used Redgate SQL Compare to copy the data from database from dev server to test sever.  Replaced the old ADN Utilities assemblies with new DoIT Utilities assemblies.  AppInventory\n Description\n The goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their developed, ongoing and future projects.  For every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group, User Departments etc.  and each application has different version.  For each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database, platforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc.  Scrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application (Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients.  After starting the project they can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts.  Responsibilities\n Entity Framework was used using Database first approach.  LINQ was used in the DAL (Data Access Layer) to interact with the Database Consumed ADO.Net Entity Frame Work for Entity Data Model, Entities, Relationship Mapping, and Querying Data.  Console Application to import the data from CSV files to populate them into the system.  Automatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and JavaScript.  Used client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in Javascript.  Worked on agile environment.  Participated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and UAT.  GoAdmin\n Description\n GoMizzou is the University of Missouri flagship mobile application, designed to provide services to all possible users of the university.  The goal of this project is to allow GoMizzou Staff to edit the master tables involved with the GoMizzou webservices.  These master tables are the starting point for all window services (which feed the web services).  Production URL\n https\n//appsprod.missouri.edu/GoAdmin Responsibilities\n Developed Application using AJAX controls like modal popup, ASP.Net server controls like listview, formview, worked on Clientside and Server side Validations and created Master Pages.  Filtering of the data of listview based on the role.  Used n-Tier Architecture, Created the Business Logic Layer by using Class Libraries to interact with database.  Modified the existing webservices like SocialSpirit, News webservices, Events web and windows services.  Created ASP.Net User Controls to reduce the complexity of user interface design Created dynamic queries, stored procedures, Views and triggers in SQL server for the database manipulation.  Mizzou Checkout\n The goal of the project is to develop a web application for Checkout process similar to shopping cart for various departments who met the certain rules.  Responsibilities\n Used Smpt server to send emails Developed C# Class Library to import the data from the CSV file to system LIM Service for late fee assessment Access to page based on the role (Role based authentication) Personalized Email for Outlook\n The goal of the project to give students to customize their outlook email.\n\n\nEducation\n\nMaster of Science  ,\nComputer Engineering\nPresent\n  University of Missouri\n\uff0d\n  State\n\nGPA\n\nGPA\n 3.7\nComputer Engineering GPA\n 3.7\n\n Bachelor of Technology  ,\nElectrical and Electronics Engineering\nMay 2013\n  Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University\n\nIndia\n GPA\n\nGPA\n 3.65\nElectrical and Electronics Engineering GPA\n 3.65\n\n Skills\n  ASP.NET, VB.Net, Active Directory, ADO.Net, Dreamweaver,\nWeb Development, AGILE, AJAX,  HTML, IDE, Java, JavaScript, JQuery, Analyst, Application Development, approach, budget, C, C++, catalogs, charts, CSS, Checkout process, client, clients, data warehouse, Database, DCL, Eclipse, edit, editor, Email, estimating, features, Frame, functional, , Logic, meetings, Access, C#, Excel, Outlook, Power point, Windows, window, Microsoft Word, Network, Operating System, page, pdf, Programmer, Programming, progress, quality, QA, Research, scheduling, Scrum, SDLC, Software Development, sorting, SQL, SQL server, tables, tutoring, user interface design, Utilities, validation, Visual Studio, website\n\n  ",

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.  Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications\n\n\n12/2001\nto\n01/2003\n  Senior Software Engineer\n Company Name\n \uff0d\n City  ,\nState\n\n As a senior developer, successfully developed and deployed a Commodity Trading System in production.

My only reason for leaving my job at Wal-Mart was because I had to get a second job for my co-op class that I had in high school. I did work both jobs for a few months but I had to quit at Wal-Mart because they couldn't work with my other job schedule. While I was an associate at Wal-Mart I did work different departments such as apparel, jewelry, and I worked as a cashier. I currently work at a Childcare to help me pursue my future career in Speech and Language Pathology. I have experience in customer service, and talking to parents and children. I consider myself a very driven hard worker, if I am given a task I complete it to my best ability.\n\n Qualifications\n\n\n Customer service mindset  Receive return merchandise  Enthusiasm  Professional appearance\n\nRestocking  Cheerfulness  Efficiency\n\n\n\n  Experience\n\nBookseller  ,\n08/2016\nto\nCurrent\n Company Name\n\uff0d\nCity  ,\nState\n\n Cleaned and straightened work area.\n\n Bagged merchandise by following standard procedures.\n\nOrganized register supplies.\n\nWorked with customer service to resolve issues\n Unboxed new merchandise.\n\n Rotated stock to maintain freshness.\n\nOperated cash register with proficiency.\n\n Provided professional and courteous service at all times.\n\nWorked overtime shifts during busy periods.\n\n\n\n Teacher/ Closer  ,\n09/2014\nto\nCurrent\n Company Name\n\uff0d\nCity  ,\nState\n\nDuring my time at Southside Christian Childcare and Preschool I have learned many things.  From simple things of how to properly sanitize a changing table to having to take care of a child after a bad accident.  I have learned how to better communicate with others, and care for children properly.  Some of my responsibilities as a teacher was to teach the children the things they should be learning according to the curriculum at that age range while also having fun.  My responsibilities as a closer included making sure all rooms were clean and ready for the next day, make sure dishes are done, and most importantly all doors are locked and secure.  Establish and enforce rules for behavior, and procedures for maintaining order.  Organize and lead activities designed to promote physical, mental and social development, such as games, arts and crafts, music, storytelling, and field trips.  Teach basic skills such as color, shape, number and letter recognition, personal hygiene, and social skills.  Observe and evaluate children's performance, behavior, social development, and physical health.  Read books to entire classes or to small groups.  Attend to children's basic needs by feeding them, dressing them, and changing their diapers.  Provide a variety of materials and resources for children to explore, manipulate and use, both in learning activities and in imaginative play.  Prepare materials and classrooms for class activities.  Identify children showing signs of emotional, developmental, or health- related problems, and discuss them with supervisors, parents or guardians, and child development specialists.  Meet with parents and guardians to discuss their children's progress and needs, determine their priorities for their children, and suggest ways that they can promote learning and development.  Adapt teaching methods and instructional materials to meet students' varying needs and interests.\n\n\n Apparel and Jewelry Associate and Cashier  ,\n04/2013\nto\n01/2015\n Company Name\n\uff0d\nCity  ,\nState\n\nMy responsibilities as a apparel associate at Wal-Mart included cleaning up apparel; folding clothes, watching over the fitting rooms, answering the telephone, putting out new merchandise, using handhelds to find out where products are, or if they are in stock.

Whether it be a skill or achievement that I can bring to the table,  there is one common denominator that all of these personal traits fall under: Teamwork.  Regardless of what job I may have had in the past, whether it be music education, recruiting, or sales, understanding that I am  existing within/leading a team allows me to clearly understand the task at hand. Communication is the number one element to a successful team.  A prolonged lack of communication can manifest itself into a negative environment, and it has been my number one priority to make sure everyone involved is on the same page.       Highlights          6+ years of B2B sales experience.  MS Office proficiency  Team building expert  Proven sales track record  Detail-oriented  Sales management      Sales  Purchasing  Quotations  Accounts receivable  Customer service  CAD experience            Accomplishments     Handled the highest volume account for current employer  Developed profitable sales strategy with new product for longtime customer   Project Management \u00a0   Supervised project production efforts to ensure projects were completed to company standards, on time and within budget constraints.         Experience      Sales   01/2007   to   02/2016     Company Name   City  ,   State       Initially hired as warehouse manager.  Oversaw receiving inventory into stock, maintaining stock, as well as pulling and shipping orders as needed.  Primarily used UPS Worldship for ground and LTL packages/pallets.  Promoted to inside sales position in 2010 In charge of DAR's largest contracted customer.  Main responsibilities involve processing large stock orders which pulled inventory from three different locations as well as drop ship orders.  Responsible for replenishing stock as needed.  Large customer service portion involved with this account.  Fielded technical and specification questions through conference calls between our company's customer as well as the end user customer.  Coordinated inspections for return items that were either defective, incorrectly supplied or did not meet the customer's needs.  Purchasing, sales, customer service as well as quotations all fall under the job description of an inside sales representative at DAR since it is a small family owned business.  Strictly defined roles are not a part of this job.  Various situations required different people to take on various responsibilities which is where communication between all stages of an order is pivotal to success.  The quotation process would be the most technical aspect of my time at D.A.R.  Calculating yields on material needed, required amount of labor (what type of labor) as well as the appropriate mark-up for any given product required constant communication between myself and the employees working the fabrication shop.  My greatest feeling of satisfaction came from quoting something never done by the company before and having that turn into an actual order.  Acquired new business for a longtime customer through competitive quotes and quick lead times for orders.  A close attention to inventory management resulted in quick lead times by making sure stock was available for custom items that customer started to purchase.  Every aspect of training for the inside sales position at D.A.R. was on the job. This gives me great confidence to branch out into other industries if so given the chance.          Music Teacher/Camp Counselor   01/2003   to   01/2007     Company Name   City  ,   State       Began as music school receptionist.

The goal throughout each week was to prepare a diverse set of songs for campers to perform during the camp's end of week concert.  I also taught private drum set lessons to several students during this time.

Several projects included the management of offsite vendor resources. Experience using the following database management tools MS SQL Server 6.5,7, 2000 and 2005, My SQL, and Oracle 9i. Proficient with MS Windows, MS Office, Minitab, Business Objects, Adobe CS3 Web Edition, Visual Studio, Frontpage, PaintShop Pro.           Experience      Information Technology Coordinator     Nov 2003   to   Current      Company Name       Provide technical support throughout the office from building and managing the web presence, networking computers and other office equipment as well as researching grant opportunities for the implementation of a technology component for the Leadership SOAR program. Responsible for building capacity for the foundation within the area of information technology by helping them move closer to a paperless environment. The scope of my role is to streamline IT operations, implement an effective online marketing and media strategy, automate the work processes for employees, and centralize the activities of GivingBack Foundation, Inc. by using the internet and other media.       Web Developer     Jun 2003   to   Current      Company Name       As webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System Development Life Cycle. All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed design specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems using Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux Hosting environment as well as providing support operations, and evaluating the overall system performance after project launch. A few key ASP.Net/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software. Clients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.       Intranet Application Support Analyst     Jan 2003   to   Jul 2007      Company Name       Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private label and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful implementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface and make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99% compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and approval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within the scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run team was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing maintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which I filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague. Implemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to 7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be completed within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10 - 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain business functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.

Projects: Atlas: Description: This project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions.  There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler.  A tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor submits availability.  A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring.  Also, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project.  The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task which runs every day.  Responsibilities: Created a Availability Calendar Grid.  In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week.  Clicking on the cell toggles the availability.  Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data) Developed C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.  Got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled.  Created Class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.  Integrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website.  Used jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations.  Used role based authorization for various pages.  The goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies.  Adding functionalities to upload pdf files.  Responsilities: Created separate Login page for Administrator and Students.  Used Active Directory (AD Group) to restrict other department Students.  Developed a web interface for Administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students.  Updated the entire application by using new Visual Studio 2013 template which make use of Bootstrap CSS by changing the master pages.  Modified the structure of database to login.  Used Redgate SQL Compare to copy the data from database from dev server to test sever.  Replaced the old ADN Utilities assemblies with new DoIT Utilities assemblies.  AppInventory: Description: The goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their developed, ongoing and future projects.  For every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group, User Departments etc.  and each application has different version.  For each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database, platforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc.  Scrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application (Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients.  After starting the project they can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts.  Responsibilities: Entity Framework was used using Database first approach.  LINQ was used in the DAL (Data Access Layer) to interact with the Database Consumed ADO.Net Entity Frame Work for Entity Data Model, Entities, Relationship Mapping, and Querying Data.  Console Application to import the data from CSV files to populate them into the system.  Automatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and JavaScript.  Used client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in Javascript.  Worked on agile environment.  Participated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and UAT.  GoAdmin: Description: GoMizzou is the University of Missouri flagship mobile application, designed to provide services to all possible users of the university.  The goal of this project is to allow GoMizzou Staff to edit the master tables involved with the GoMizzou webservices.  These master tables are the starting point for all window services (which feed the web services).  Production URL: https://appsprod.missouri.edu/GoAdmin Responsibilities: Developed Application using AJAX controls like modal popup, ASP.Net server controls like listview, formview, worked on Clientside and Server side Validations and created Master Pages.  Filtering of the data of listview based on the role.  Used n-Tier Architecture, Created the Business Logic Layer by using Class Libraries to interact with database.  Modified the existing webservices like SocialSpirit, News webservices, Events web and windows services.  Created ASP.Net User Controls to reduce the complexity of user interface design Created dynamic queries, stored procedures, Views and triggers in SQL server for the database manipulation.  Mizzou Checkout: The goal of the project is to develop a web application for Checkout process similar to shopping cart for various departments who met the certain rules.  Responsibilities: Used Smpt server to send emails Developed C# Class Library to import the data from the CSV file to system LIM Service for late fee assessment Access to page based on the role (Role based authentication) Personalized Email for Outlook: The goal of the project to give students to customize their outlook email.
